    <h3> My 3 Mistakes-Rajesh Hamal</h3>
    <p> My father was against my decision to pursue acting as a profession because, at that time, it was not considered
        as a good career option. He suggested me to choose any other profession and even warned me that he would get
        disconnected with me if I disobey his suggestion. Despite that, I, being an adamant and arrogant young adult who
        was very passionate about acting, just went along with it. I had thought that my success will compel my father
        to forgive me, and we will be able to rekindle our ties. However, I was wrong because I never got a chance to do
        that.

        As a 2-years-old in film industry, I was working for my fourth film when my father left for Pakistan to shoulder
        his responsibilities as ‘Ambassador of Nepal to Pakistan’. My father, who hadn’t watched any of my films, had
        only been in Pakistan for a month when he died of a cardiac arrest at the age of 56. I had never expected that
        he would leave this world so early.

        Every day of my life, I regret not bidding him with a proper goodbye. Additionally, I should have made an effort
        to properly communicate with my father, and talk about my aspirations and passion in a better way.
