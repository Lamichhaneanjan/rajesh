        <p> Rajesh Hamal: the son of a diplomat, a scholarly man with a master’s degree in English Literature, a
            Goodwill Ambassador and recurrent contributor to charity. But you may know him better as the ‘Great Actor’
            of Nepal, starring in award winning films such as Deuta(1992), for which he won the first of many Best Actor
            Awards by the National Film Award, the most prestigious cinematic awards association in Nepal. Since his
            film debut in the late 1980’s and his seemingly overnight rise to stardom, he has become one of the most, if
            not the most, iconic figures of Nepali cinema.
        </p>
        <p>
            His roles ranged in character and variety from light hearted romantic comedy,to seat-gripping action and
            adventure. His cinematic success has not gone unnoticed; he’s the recipient of three decades worth of Best
            Actor awards and nominations, in addition to numerous other achievements. It seems as if there is nothing
            that Mr. Hamal cannot do. Rajesh Hamal has become common household name in Nepal. His dedicated acting
            career has redefined the classifications of what it means to be a Nepali actor.
